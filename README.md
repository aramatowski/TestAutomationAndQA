# TestAutomationAndQA

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
Testing thoroughly can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure. For this project, I used JUnit tests to test that each part of the code functions the way that it is intended to. The next step with testing would be to integrate those parts together and test the way they work together. 

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
I used the requirements for the project and created user stories to interpret the user needs. Then, I used the user needs and separated them into specific requirements for the program to ensure that each user need was implemented. 

**How do I approach designing software?**
I approach designing software by first identifying user and system requirements. Then I used visual aids to plan the code, then create the code and test.
